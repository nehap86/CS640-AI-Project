# CS640-AI-Project
Final Project -CS640 News-Image Classification

##Synopsis
We are given a set of news images related to different kind of events. The images are labeled with whether something occured in the image, such as violence, fire and a protest. An image can have several labels if a scene contains both a protest and violence, and it is possible an image has no label if it is not related to any events of interest to be labeled. Our goal is to implement an AI system that predicts the labels of the image. The dataset contains 40,000 images where 32,000 is for model training and 8,000 is for model testing. Also we are given an annotation txt file that has labels(“protest,” “sign,” “photo,” “fire,” “police,” “children,” “flag,” “night,” and “shouting” etc) indicating 0 or 1 for a particular image according to their presence in that image.
